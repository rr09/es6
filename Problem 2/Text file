First of, the data set is stored in the bigBangTheory variable.

Then we store the episode array in a variable called episodes.

We declare three functions namely, get_episode_info, get_episodeById and searchByEpisodeName. 

In the first function, we use a for of loop to loop through the episodes and check if the inputted season and 
episode number match with the season number and episode number in the episodes array. x here is the individual objects from
the episodes array.
If  the conditions match, we store the boolean value 'true' in the episodeFound and seasonFound variables. 
Else the boolean value 'false' is stored.
Then we check for three different conditions and store the boolean values accordingly.
If true, the episode info is displayed else an error message is displayed.

In the second function we use two for of loops; one to loop through episodes array and the other to loop through the input id array.
The user input array contains multiple inputs.These CSVs are converted to an array using .split().
Also, when multiple ids are sent as arguments, we can use the REST parameters which convert the CSVs into array. 
(Whenever there are multiple paramEters to a function, we can define an extra parameter using "..."   It stores all
the inputs that are passed into a function into an array.)
Then the ids are matched and the episode info corresponding to the id is displayed.
If  unknown ids are typed, an error message is thrown.

In the third function, the same approach of for of loop and if conditions are used to search for the episode name and 
display the info.
